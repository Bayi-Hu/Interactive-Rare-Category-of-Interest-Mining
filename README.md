## Interactive-Rare-Category-of-Interest-Mining

Code and models released for the paper ["Interactive-Rare-Category-of-Interest-Mining"](https://)

We will also release two dataset for rare category mining soon, i.e., Bird and Game.

`IRim_RCD.py` is the IRim algorithm for rare category detection.

`IRim_RCE.py` is the IRim algorithm for rate category exploration.

` Offline_abstraction` is the code for offline abstraction construction process.

`Configuration.py` is the parameter configuration used in the experiment.

To run the code, you may first run ` Offinle_abstraction.py`  for abstraction construction, then run `IRim_RCD.py` to interactively detect few samples for rare-category-of-interest, and eventually run `IRim_RCE.py` to explore as much as possible samples from rare-category-of-interest.
